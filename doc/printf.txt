=============================================================================
1. Printf					*printf*

Turn a line consisting of tokens separated by commas into a printf statement.
A token is recognized as a sequence of any characters expect for whitespace
and comma but with respect to balanced brackets and parentheses. Examples
showing the line before and after invoking |:Printf|:

	Before		After
	x		printf("x=%d\n", x);
	x, x/y		printf("x=%d, x/y=%d\n", x, x/y);
	pow(x, y)	printf("pow(x, y)=%d\n", pow(x, y));

The default |b:printf_pattern| assumes that every token is an integer
expression. Deducting the correct type of each token is hard. However, the
cursor is moved to the first directive (%) which allows for modification of
the conversion specifier. Pressing |;| will therefore move the cursor to the
next directive.

						*:Printf*
:Printf			Turn the current line into a printf statement.

=============================================================================
2. Pattern					*b:printf_pattern*

The pattern used to construct the printf statement can be specified using
|b:printf_pattern| and defaults to:

	printf("%d\n", %s);

The pattern must include exactly two substitution directives, meaning a "%"
character followed by one or more |/\w| characters or a period. The first
directive will be used as the directive in the formatted string and the later
will be substituted with the current line. Examples using different patterns
showing the line before and after invoking |:Printf|:

	Pattern			Before	After
	printf("%d\n", %s)	x	printf("x=%d\n", x)
	printf("%s\n", %s)	x	printf("x=%s\n", x)
	printf("%.2f\n", %s)	x	printf("x=%.2f\n", x)

Since |b:printf_pattern| is a |buffer-variable| the pattern can be altered
for a given |FileType|:

	autocmd FileType vim let b:printf_pattern = 'echom printf("%s", %s)'

Below is a table of sensible patterns for different filetypes:

	Filetype	Pattern
	c		fprintf(stderr, __FILE__ ": %d\n", %s);
	go		fmt.Printf("%v\n", %s)
	ruby		printf("%p\n", %s)
	vim		echom printf("%s", %s)
